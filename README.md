## About this project

I built this site using [Puppy](https://github.com/Upstatement/puppy) üê∂, Upstatement's starter kit for [rapid prototyping](https://upstatement.com/blog/hello-puppy/). It's pretty simple, overall. It uses Twig for templating and takes care of build, browser, formatting and other environment settings that we love to deal with.

I love working on my portfolio, and it's evolved so much over the years ‚Äî always serving as a playground for my design and dev chops while helping me reflect on my career and accomplishments. Yet, I have a tendency to blow it up and start over often (I think it's fun), but here's where it's at right now.

My love for typography and printing influenced this design and influences much of my work in general. I think constraints imposed by print and digital design complement each other in lovely ways, and I tried to play with them a bit here.

Finally, I'm working to detail more about the process behind my featured projects and rethinking how I want to utilize case studies. Check back for updates!

## Colophon

I'm a big typography geek so choosing my portfolio typefaces was a big deal. I went through a ton of potential candidates before choosing these two.

- **[Noort](https://www.type-together.com/noort-font)** by [Juan Bruce](https://www.type-together.com/juan-bruce) at [TypeTogether](https://www.type-together.com/).

    Noort is a serif typeface with a lot of charm and I can't not think of [Pingu](https://media1.tenor.com/images/44471015b444baa3fa4a36ce8574566f/tenor.gif?itemid=6123519) the penguin when I see the name "noort." üêß It's fun and has some nice quirks (the "k," "Q" and ampersand) along with some chunky serifs. It's very legible and, overall, I feel like it's a very good representation of _me_.

- **[Neue Machina](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-machina?variant=14717504225322)** by [PangramPangram](https://pangrampangram.com/) and [Baugasm](http://baugasm.com/).

  Neue Machina is a punchy sans serif with monospace qualities and a ton of character(s) ..haha. Quite frankly, there are too many lovely quirks to point out, so I'll just mention the bendy-strawesque terminals and the deep ink traps. (I'm a sucker for ink traps!)

  PangramPangram calls it a a font "suited for the future of technology" and I'll gladly take that to include the future of digital journalism as well.
