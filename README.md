## About this project

Most of the work for this site was completed in 2020 using using [Puppy](https://github.com/Upstatement/puppy) üê∂, Upstatement's starter kit for [rapid prototyping](https://upstatement.com/blog/hello-puppy/). At the core, I wanted a simple, no-fuss, no-frills set up to get building quickly. It's a static site using [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) for templating and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting.

In 2021, I've mainly applied a fresh coat of paint to the styles to reflect a more refined approach to colour and where my current tastes are at.

On my to do list still is adding more detail about the process behind some featured projects and rethinking how I want to utilise case studies. Check back for updates :)

## Colophon

I'm a big typography geek so choosing my portfolio typefaces was a big deal. I went through a ton of potential candidates before choosing these two.

- **[Noort](https://www.type-together.com/noort-font)** by [Juan Bruce](https://www.type-together.com/juan-bruce) at [TypeTogether](https://www.type-together.com/).

    Noort is a serif typeface with a lot of charm and I can't not think of [Pingu](https://media1.tenor.com/images/44471015b444baa3fa4a36ce8574566f/tenor.gif?itemid=6123519) the penguin when I see the name "noort." üêß It's fun and has some nice quirks (the "k," "Q" and ampersand) along with some chunky serifs. It's very legible and, overall, I feel like it's a very good representation of _me_.

- **[Neue Machina](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-machina?variant=14717504225322)** by [PangramPangram](https://pangrampangram.com/) and [Baugasm](http://baugasm.com/).

  Neue Machina is a punchy sans serif with monospace qualities and a ton of character. There are just too many lovely quirks to point out, so I'll only mention the bendy-strawesque terminals and the deep ink traps. (I'm a sucker for ink traps!)

  PangramPangram calls it a font "suited for the future of technology" and I'll poetically take that to include the future of digital journalism as well.
